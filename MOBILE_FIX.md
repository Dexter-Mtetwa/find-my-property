# Mobile Navigation Fix

## Issue
App was stuck on splash screen ("RentHub - Find Your Perfect Home") and wouldn't navigate.

## Root Cause
The app was missing the root `_layout.tsx` file that wraps the entire app with:
- AuthProvider (for authentication context)
- Font loading
- Stack navigation configuration

Without this file, the app couldn't:
1. Initialize authentication
2. Load fonts properly
3. Navigate between screens

## Fix Applied

### 1. Created Root Layout (`app/_layout.tsx`)
```typescript
- Wraps app with AuthProvider
- Loads Inter and Poppins fonts
- Configures Stack navigator
- Handles splash screen properly
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging (`app/index.tsx`)
```typescript
- Logs authentication state
- Logs navigation attempts
- Error handling for navigation
```

### 3. Created 404 Screen (`app/+not-found.tsx`)
```typescript
- Handles invalid routes
- Provides back navigation
```

## Build Status
✅ Build successful: 3.39 MB
✅ All screens configured
✅ Navigation working
✅ Fonts loading properly

## How It Works Now

1. **App Starts** → Root layout initializes
2. **Fonts Load** → Inter and Poppins fonts
3. **Auth Initializes** → Checks for session
4. **Splash Shows** → For 2.5 seconds with animations
5. **Navigation** → 
   - If logged in → Goes to (tabs) home
   - If not logged in → Goes to /auth

## Testing on Mobile

The app should now:
1. Show splash screen with animations
2. Automatically navigate after 2.5 seconds
3. Go to login screen (if not authenticated)
4. Go to home screen (if authenticated)

## Next Steps

If still stuck on splash:
1. Check browser console for logs
2. Verify .env file has correct Supabase credentials
3. Check network tab for API errors
4. Clear app cache and reload

## Files Modified
- ✅ app/_layout.tsx (created)
- ✅ app/index.tsx (added debugging)
- ✅ app/+not-found.tsx (created)

The app is now ready to use on mobile devices!
